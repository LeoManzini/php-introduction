## VS Code shortcuts edition

To make it easy the change from Intellij to VS Code, I'm editing some keybindings to increase productivity. 

To change the shortcuts you need to see them first. On VS Code goes to `File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts` or just use the shortcut `Ctrl+k Ctrl+s` but you have to be fast. Here you have the shortcuts list, where you can see them and edit.

Some changes I've made so far:

- Add line comment and Toogle Line Comment: `Ctrl + /`;
- Opens terminal (without start a new terminal session): `Alt + F12`;
- Opens terminal (starting new terminal session): `Shift + Alt + F12`;
